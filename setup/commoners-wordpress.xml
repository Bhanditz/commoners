		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="lead">If you or your organization would like to join the Creative Commons Global Network, this is the place to start.</p>
There are two types of membership in the network: Individual Membership, for individual human beings, and  Institutional Membership, for institutions.

You probably want to join the Global Network as an individual member. This allows you to participate in the global network with full voting rights and to create and communicate via a personal profile on this site.

<a class="cc-btn" style="width: 20em;" href="/sign-up/individual/">Join as an Individual Member</a>

If your organization wants to join the Global Network as an Institutional Member, you can apply here on their behalf.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>LET’S GET STARTED</h1>
<strong>To join the Creative Commons Global network as an individual human being you will need:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>A CCID login account. If you don't have one, it only takes a minute to <a href="https://login.creativecommons.org/register.php">sign up here</a>.</li>
 	<li>Two people who are already part of the network and know you well enough to vouch for you. You'll have the opportunity to search for them in the next step of this process.</li>
 	<li>A recognizable name in the community. This doesn't have to be the name on your birth certificate, but should be one that you are known by.</li>
</ul>
<strong>
Once you have completed the sign-up process:
</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>You will have agreed to the Global Network Code of Conduct and the usage policy for this site.</li>
 	<li>Your application will have been viewed by the people you have nominated to vouch for you, and by the Global Council.</li>
 	<li>Your photograph, username, and the social media account names you provide during sign-up will be published and publicly visible on this site.</li>
</ul>
Sound good?

Effective as of 7 November 2017 (previously updated 22 December 2014 and 7 February 2017)
<h3 id="general-information-regarding-these-terms-of-use">1. General Information Regarding These Terms of Use</h3>
Master terms: Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Creative Commons (“Creative Commons,” “CC,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). Unless otherwise noted on a particular site or service, these master terms of use (“Master Terms”) apply to your use of all of the websites that Creative Commons Corporation operates. These include <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">http://creativecommons.org</a>, <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/">http://wiki.creativecommons.org</a>, <a href="http://openpolicynetwork.org/">http://openpolicynetwork.org</a>, <a href="http://open4us.org/">http://open4us.org</a>, <a class="uri" href="https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/">https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/</a>, <a href="http://teamopen.cc/">http://teamopen.cc</a>, <a href="https://donate.creativecommons.org/">http://donate.creativecommons.org</a>, <a href="http://thepowerofopen.org/">http://thepowerofopen.org</a>, <a class="uri" href="https://network.creativecommons.org">https://network.creativecommons.org</a> and <a href="https://creativecommons.net/">http://creativecommons.net</a>, together with all other subdomains thereof (the “ccNet Website”), (collectively, the “Websites”), as well as the products, information, and services provided through the Websites, including without limitation the license chooser, legal tools, the CC Login Services (defined below), and the CC Global Network community website (the “CCGN website”) (the CCGN websites together with the Websites, the “Services”). Creative Commons does not operate the website at <a href="http://ccmixter.org/">http://ccmixter.org</a>. Furthermore, this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of the websites operated by affiliates or chapters of Creative Commons unless expressly provided on those websites or any subdomains of the Websites. For purposes of these Master Terms, “CC Login Services” refers to CC’s implementation of the OpenID standard used on the ccNet Website, and the Central Authentication Service (CAS protocol) used on <a class="uri" href="https://login.creativecommons.org">https://login.creativecommons.org</a>

Additional terms: In addition to the Master Terms, your use of any Services may also be subject to specific terms applicable to a particular Service (“Additional Terms”). If there is any conflict between the Additional Terms and the Master Terms, then the Additional Terms apply in relation to the relevant Service.

Collectively, the Terms: The Master Terms, together with any Additional Terms, form a binding legal agreement between you and Creative Commons in relation to your use of the Services. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the “Terms.”

<strong>Human-readable summary of Sec 1: These terms, together with any special terms for particular websites, create a contract between you and Creative Commons. The contract governs your use of all websites operated by Creative Commons, unless a particular website indicates otherwise. These human-readable summaries of each section are not part of the contract, but are intended to help you understand its terms.</strong>
<h3 id="your-agreement-to-the-terms">2. Your Agreement to the Terms</h3>
BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT” OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING ANY OF THE SERVICES (INCLUDING THE LICENSES, PUBLIC DOMAIN TOOLS, AND CHOOSERS), YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREED TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS. By clicking “I ACCEPT” or otherwise accessing or using any Services you also represent that you have the legal authority to accept the Terms on behalf of yourself and any party you represent in connection with your use of any Services. If you do not agree to the Terms, you are not authorized to use any Services. If you are an individual who is entering into these Terms on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the power to bind that entity, and you hereby agree on that entity’s behalf to be bound by these Terms, with the terms “you,” and “your” applying to you, that entity, and other users accessing the Services on behalf of that entity.

<strong>Human-readable summary of Sec 2: Please read these terms and only use our sites and services if you agree to them.</strong>
<h3 id="changes-to-the-terms">3. Changes to the Terms</h3>
From time to time, Creative Commons may change, remove, or add to the Terms, and reserves the right to do so in its discretion. In that case, we will post updated Terms and indicate the date of revision. If we feel the modifications are material, we will make reasonable efforts to post a prominent notice on the relevant Website(s) and notify those of you with a current CC Login Service account via email. All new and/or revised Terms take effect immediately and apply to your use of the Services from that date on, except that material changes will take effect 30 days after the change is made and identified as material. Your continued use of any Services after new and/or revised Terms are effective indicates that you have read, understood, and agreed to those Terms.

<strong>Human-readable summary of Sec 3: These terms may change. When the changes are important, we will put a notice on the website. If you continue to use the sites after the changes are made, you agree to the changes.</strong>
<h3 id="no-legal-advice">4. No Legal Advice</h3>
Creative Commons is not a law firm, does not provide legal advice, and is not a substitute for a law firm. Sending us an email or using any of the Services, including the licenses, public domain tools, and choosers, does not constitute legal advice or create an attorney-client relationship.

<strong>Human-readable summary of Sec 4: Some of us are lawyers, but we aren’t your lawyer. Please consult your own attorney if you need legal advice.</strong>
<h3 id="content-available-through-the-services">5. Content Available through the Services</h3>
<em>Provided as-is</em>: You acknowledge that Creative Commons does not make any representations or warranties about the material, data, and information, such as data files, text, computer software, code, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos, or other images (collectively, the “Content”) which you may have access to as part of, or through your use of, the Services. Under no circumstances is Creative Commons liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to: any infringing Content, any errors or omissions in Content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, transmitted, linked from, or otherwise accessible through or made available via the Services. You understand that by using the Services, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, or objectionable.

You agree that you are solely responsible for your reuse of Content made available through the Services, including providing proper attribution. You should review the terms of the applicable license before you use the Content so that you know what you can and cannot do.

<em>Licensing</em>: CC-Owned Content: Other than the text of Creative Commons licenses, CC0, and other legal tools and the text of the deeds for all legal tools (all of which are made available under the CC0 Public Domain Dedication), Creative Commons trademarks (subject to the Trademark Policy), and the software code, all Content on the Websites is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license, unless otherwise marked. See the CC Policies page for more information.

<em>CC-Owned Code</em>: All of CC’s software code is free software; please check our code repository for the specific license on software you want to reuse.

<em>Search Tools</em>: On some of its Websites, Creative Commons provides website search tools, including CC Search, which return Content based on any license information our search tools are able to locate and interpret. Those search tools may return Content that is not CC licensed, and you should independently verify the terms of the license attached to any Content you intend to use.

<strong>Human-readable summary of Sec 5: We try our best to have useful information on our sites, but we cannot promise that everything is accurate or appropriate for your situation. Content on the site is licensed under CC BY 4.0 unless it says it is available under different terms.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Master Privacy Policy and Express Consent</h2>
<h3>1. Preamble</h3>
This Master Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains the collection, use, processing, transferring and disclosure of “personal information” by Creative Commons Corporation (“CC” or “Creative Commons”), a Massachusetts charitable organization, and also contains an Express Consent that applies to those who use our Websites and Services (as defined below). This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and made part of Creative Commons Master Terms of Use (“Master Terms”) located at <a href="https://creativecommons.org/terms">https://creativecommons.org/terms</a>.

Unless otherwise noted on a particular website or service hosted by Creative Commons, this Privacy Policy applies to your use of all websites that Creative Commons operates. These include <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">http://creativecommons.org</a>, <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/">http://wiki.creativecommons.org</a>, <a href="http://openpolicynetwork.org/">http://openpolicynetwork.org</a>, <a href="http://open4us.org/">http://open4us.org</a>, <a href="https://rightsback.org">https://rightsback.org</a>, <a href="https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/">https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/</a>, <a href="http://teamopen.cc/">http://teamopen.cc</a>, <a href="https://donate.creativecommons.org/">http://donate.creativecommons.org</a>, <a href="http://thepowerofopen.org/">http://thepowerofopen.org</a>, <a href="https://network.creativecommons.org">https://network.creativecommons.org</a> and <a href="https://creativecommons.net/">http://creativecommons.net</a>, together with all other subdomains thereof (the “ccNet Website”), (collectively, the “Websites”). This Privacy Policy also applies to all products, information, and services provided through the Websites, including without limitation the license chooser, legal tools, the CC Login Services (defined below), and the CC Global Network community website (the “CCGN website (together with the Websites, the “Services”). Creative Commons does not operate the website at <a href="http://ccmixter.org/">http://ccmixter.org</a>. Furthermore, this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of the websites operated by affiliates or chapters of Creative Commons unless expressly provided on those websites or any subdomains of the Websites. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “CC Login Services” refers to CC’s implementation of the OpenID standard used on the ccNet Website, and the Central Authentication Service (CAS protocol) used on <a href="https://login.creativecommons.org">https://login.creativecommons.org</a>.

In addition, supplemental Privacy Policy terms (“Supplemental Privacy Policy Terms”) may apply to a particular Service, such as the Scholar’s Copyright Addendum Engine ( <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/resources/supplemental-privacy-policy/">http://sciencecommons.org/resources/supplemental-privacy-policy/</a>) and rightsback.org (https://rightsback.org/privacy-policy/). All such Supplemental Privacy Policy Terms will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that particular Service.

This Privacy Policy also explains our commitment to you with respect to our use, processing, transfer and disclosure of non personal browsing and site usage data that Creative Commons collects as the provider of the Services. “Non personal browsing and site usage data” refers to information that CC collects indirectly and automatically about your activities while visiting the Websites and using the Services through tools such as Google Analytics. The type of information that we collect focuses on general information such as general location such as country or city where you are located (not intentionally fine-grained location information), pages visited, heat-map of visitors’ activity on the site, information about the browser you are using, etc. In addition, whenever you use a CC Login Service to log into a Website or use the Services, our servers (which, again, may be hosted by a third party service provider) keep a plain text log of the websites you visit and when you visit them. CC does not deliberately track people over the Internet. See section 11, below for more information about this.

As used in this policy, “personal information” means information that would allow a party to identify you such as, for example, your name, address or location, telephone number, or email address or information from which a person could deduce your identity.

The information that you submit on your public profile page, including but not limited to information you provide in the field “Your CC Story” and any photograph or image of yourself you choose to upload, is posted by you at your discretion (although subject to ccNet’s Master Terms of Use). You should not post photos or images of other persons without their express consent. The information you publish on your public profile page, including your personal information, may be used by anyone who views that information for any lawful purpose, with the exception of the text you insert in the “Your CC Story” field and any photograph or image of yourself that you upload, which if you choose to provide in either case must be licensed under and becomes subject to the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License, as stated on the Edit Profile page. CC may use the personal and non personal browsing and site usage date (as described above) you provide in your public profile, including the text in the “Your CC Story” field (subject to the terms of that license), to promote the mission of Creative Commons.
<h3>6. CC Global Network (CCGN)</h3>
In connection with your application to the CCGN or use of the CCGN website, you will be required to provide certain personal information. We use and process that personal information to evaluate your application, establish and maintain your account, provide you with the features we provide for account holders, and for the purpose of contacting you about upcoming news and events relevant to Creative Commons and the CCGN. In connection with your application you will be required to have one or more members of the CCGN provide information about you in order to vouch for you as a potential member of the CCGN. You hereby consent to those individuals providing such information about you that we reasonably request. The personal information provided in connection with your application to the CCGN, whether by you or a member of the CCGN vouching as you voluntarily request on your behalf, will be used by the CCGN including its Membership Council (interim and/or permanent) and Creative Commons to evaluate your application.

If you are admitted to the CCGN you will be given a public profile page where you can voluntarily post personal information for public viewing. Certain personal information that you submit to or make available on your profile page, including your name, areas of interest, images and other content you upload may be used by anyone who views that information for any lawful purpose. Additional personal information that you submit to your profile page, including your biographical information, languages spoken, country of residence or country with which you wish to be associated or similar, social media account information or URL details may be viewed and used by other members of the CCGN. Further, if you are admitted, your information will be transferred to and from the various fora that further the CC mission and enable the CCGN, including chapters, the CCGN, platforms and working groups, HQ and the Membership Council for purposes of governance participation, activity interaction, and other purposes related to the mission, vision and activities of CC.

Whether your CCGN membership application is rejected or accepted, the personal information that was collected from you and from the voucher will be deleted after 21 days of CC's sending out the decision, with the exception of the voucher's decision (e.g., vouch for applicant / does not vouch for applicant) and your then-existing or prior affiliation(s) as or with a CC affiliate.

Information provided by vouchers related to your identity and decision (i.e., whether or not you (the voucher) vouched for the applicant) will be retained.

See sections 15 and 22 below for additional information.
<h3>7. Participating in the CCGN</h3>
<strong>Registered Users</strong> . When you register to obtain a user account on any of the Services (any such person, a “Registered User”), including but not limited to a CC Login Service or the CCGN website, you may be asked to provide personal information to create your account and establish a password and profile. We generally encourage you to use an alias or nickname if you are not comfortable providing your legal name. The name or nickname you provide in connection with your account may be used to attribute you in connection with any content you submit to any Service. We also use that personal information to establish and maintain your account, to provide you with the features we provide Registered Users, and to email you regarding changes to this policy or other applicable policies. If you sign up to receive updates from Creative Commons when you create your account, we will use your personal information to send you communications about Creative Commons news and campaigns.

Any other personal information that we may collect which is not described specifically in this Privacy Policy will only be collected, processed, transferred and used in accordance with the Principles and as stated herein.
<h3>8. Disclosures of Personal Information</h3>
In general, it is not Creative Commons’ practice to disclose personal information to third parties other than as made available on the Services. Except as otherwise set forth herein or for providing you with attribution using your CC Login Service name or nickname (as you have elected) in connection with your CC-licensed works, we may share your personal information in the following instances:
<ol>
 	<li>First, Creative Commons may share personal information with our contractors and service providers in order to maintain, enhance, or add to the functionality of the Services, to organize and run an event you signed up to attend, to evaluate your application for funding and/or participation in a program run by Creative Commons, or to otherwise run any CC program or activity in which you have chosen to participate.</li>
 	<li>Second, we may disclose your personal information you provide in connection with your application to the CCGN or use of the CCGN website, including to those individuals who you select to vouch for your acceptance as a member of the CCGN and those reviewing your application, and the Membership Counsel (interim and/or permanent) whose members are located in various countries (such as Colombia, El Salvador, Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Argentina, South Korea, Poland, Ghana, Brazil, United States, Japan, Netherlands, Chile, and Guatemala), for the purpose of making a decision about your application.</li>
 	<li>Third, if you are a voucher, we may disclose your personal information to (a) the Membership Council (interim and/or permanent), for the purpose of confirming the voucher's identity and for making a decision about the applicant, and (b) the applicant should the applicant decide to invoke his or her right of access and correction as discussed below in sections 21 and 22.</li>
 	<li>Fourth, we may disclose your personal information to third parties in a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) take action regarding suspected illegal activities; (b) enforce or apply our Master Terms and this Privacy Policy; (c) enforce our Charter [link] including the Code of Conduct and policies contained and incorporated therein, (d) comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order; or (e) address legitimate interests pursued by Creative Commons or by a third party (except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child) and ensure our compliance with applicable laws.</li>
</ol>
For the purposes listed in section 3 above, Creative Commons may transfer your personal information to Creative Commons affiliates, members, chapters, and third parties that provide products or services to Creative Commons. The majority of consultants that Creative Commons is using as of the effective date of this Privacy Policy were located in the United States and in Canada, but this may change from time to time. For example, Creative Commons has engaged a third-party Internet service to provide hosting services for some of our Websites based in the United Kingdom.

When personal information is directly transferred to an affiliate, member, Chapter or a third party provider located in a country including those listed above, that may not provide a level of protection equivalent to the laws in your jurisdiction, Creative Commons will exercise appropriate due diligence in the selection of such recipients, and require that these recipients maintain adequate technical and organizational security measures to safeguard the personal information and process the personal information only as instructed by Creative Commons and for no other purposes. See also section 20 below.
<h3>9. Security of Personal Information Collected via the Services</h3>
Creative Commons has implemented reasonable physical, technical, and organizational security measures for personal information that Creative Commons processes, transfers, stores and controls against accidental or unlawful destruction, or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, in compliance with applicable law. However, no website can fully eliminate security risks. Third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. If any data breach occurs, we will post a reasonably prominent notice to the Websites and comply with all other applicable data privacy requirements including, when required, personal notice to you if you have provided and we have maintained an email address for you.

The CC Login Services account systems have security risks in addition to those described above. Among other things, they are vulnerable to DNS attacks, and using any CC Login Service may increase the risk of phishing. See “More about CC Login Services” below and other information about those services throughout this Privacy Policy.
<h3>10. Information from Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3>
We and our service providers (for example, Google Analytics as described in section 1 above) may collect information using cookies or similar technologies for the purposes described above and below. Cookies are pieces of information that are stored by your browser on the hard drive or memory of your computer or other Internet access device.  Cookies may enable us to personalize your experience on the Services, maintain a persistent session, passively collect demographic information about your computer, and monitor advertisements and other activities.  The Websites may use different kinds of cookies and other types of local storage (such as browser-based or plugin-based local storage).
<h3>11. Non Personal Browsing and Site Usage Information We Process and Collect</h3>
When you use the Services, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) may process and collect information indirectly and automatically (through, for example, the use of your “IP address”) about your activities while visiting the Websites and using our Services, and information about the country you are located in and the browser you are using. In addition, we use website and application analytics services provided by third parties that use cookies and other similar technologies to collect information about the use of the Websites and Services, and to report trends, without identifying individual visitors (this is all “non personal browsing and site usage information” for purposes of this Privacy Policy and as described in section 1, above). The third parties that provide us with these services may also collect information about your use of third-party websites. You can learn about Google’s practices in connection with this information collection and how to opt out of it by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>. Whenever you use your CCGN website account or a CC Login Service, our servers (which, again, may be hosted by a third party service provider) keep a log of the websites you visit and when you visit them. We may share the non personal browsing information we collect with our third party service providers in connection with the services they provide.
<h3>12. No Linking</h3>
We do not intentionally link browsing information or information from our CC Login Services server logs to the personal information you submit to us. We use this information for internal purposes only, such as to help understand how the Services are being used, to improve our Services, and for systems administration purposes. CC may use a third party analytics provider (for example, Google Analytics as discussed in section 1 above) to help us collect and analyze non personal browsing and site usage information through operation of our Services for those same purposes.

In connection with your use of the Services, you may tag content, create lists of favorite content, and do other things to personalize your experience. You should not, however, tag other persons or post photographs or other images or likenesses without that other person's express consent. This information will be retained by Creative Commons in connection with the relevant CC Login Service.
<h3>13. No Selling or Sharing</h3>
Except in the unique situations identified in this Privacy Policy, Creative Commons does not sell or otherwise voluntarily provide the non personal browsing information we collect and process about you or your website usage to third parties.
<h3>14. No Access; More about CC Login Services</h3>
As a provider of CC Login Services, CC could access your web-based account tied to such services, and could log in on behalf of any of Registered Users to any of the accounts they have accessed using the CC Login Services. Creative Commons will never use this technical login ability for any purpose except as required by law.
<h3>15. Data Retention</h3>
CC generally discards non personal browsing information from our CC Login Services and CCGN website once we have used the information for the limited purposes noted above under “No Linking” and described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. Nevertheless, we may, but are not obligated to, retain certain data in connection with routine information technology backups and for archival purposes.

When a CCGN membership application is rejected or accepted, the personal information that was collected from the applicant and from the voucher will be deleted after 21 days of CC's sending out the decision, with the exception of the voucher' decision (e.g., vouch for applicant / does not vouch for applicant) and your then-existing or prior affiliation(s) as or with a CC affiliate. Personal information submitted by someone acting as a voucher and collected for the purpose of providing a voucher for an applicant that is rejected or accepted will be deleted after 21 days from the time CC sends out its decision, with the exception of the voucher's actual decision (i.e., whether or not he or she vouched for the applicant, but none of the statement(s) that he or she may have provided).
<h3>16. Notice</h3>
Any other non-personal information that we collect which is not described specifically in this Privacy Policy will only be collected, processed, transferred and used in accordance with the Principles.
<h3>17. Reorganization or Spin-Offs</h3>
Creative Commons may transfer some or all of your personal and/or non personal browsing information to a third party as a result of a reorganization, spin-off, or similar transaction. Upon such transfer, the acquirer’s privacy policy will apply. In such event, Creative Commons will use reasonable efforts to notify you and to ensure that at the time of the transaction the acquirer’s privacy policy complies with the Principles and with all applicable laws.
<h3>18. Children</h3>
The Services are not directed at children under the age of 13. Consistent with the U.S. federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personal information from anyone under the age of 13 without requiring parental consent. Our Master Terms specifically prohibit anyone using our Services from submitting any personally identifiable information about persons under 13 years of age. Any person who provides their personal information to CC through the Services represents that they are 13 years of age or older.
<h3>19. Third-Party Sites</h3>
The Services may include links to other websites. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party sites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other websites.
<h3>20. Special Note to International Users</h3>
If you are accessing or using the Services in regions with laws governing data collection, processing, transfer and use, please note that we may transfer your information to recipients in countries other than the country in which the information was originally collected. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. The Services are hosted in the United States and the United Kingdom. Please note that your personal information may be located on servers in the United States and/or the United Kingdom. By providing your personal information and by checking all required boxes when you apply for membership in the CCGN or otherwise access and use our Services or Websites, you expressly consent to the use of your personal information for the uses identified above in accordance with the Privacy Policy.

The personal information you provide to Creative Commons when you apply for CCGN membership will be shared with the members of the Membership Council (interim and/or permanent) for the purpose of making a decision on your application. These members may be located in countries other than the country in which the information was originally collected, for instance Colombia, El Salvador, Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Argentina, South Korea, Poland, Ghana, Brazil, United States, Japan, the Netherlands, Chile, and Guatemala. The data protection laws of such countries might not provide a level of protection equivalent to the laws in your jurisdiction. Creative Commons will exercise appropriate due diligence in the selection of such members, and require that these members maintain adequate technical and organizational security measures to safeguard the personal information and process the personal information only as instructed by Creative Commons and for no other purposes. Data transferred from the European Union to the United States or outside the European Union will be made on the grounds of a certification to the E.U./U.S. Privacy Shield regime and/or a data transfer agreement based on the Standard Contractual Clauses approved of by the European Commission respectively, consistent with applicable data privacy requirements.
<h3>21. Accuracy of Personal Information Collected</h3>
Creative Commons intends to keep personal information accurate and up-to-date. We also retain personal information no longer than is necessary to carry out the purposes described in section 3 above, or as required by law. If changes need to be made to your personal information, please notify us (as identified below, see the “Questions” section) right away. If you inform us of changes or we otherwise become aware of any factual inaccuracies in personal information, we will promptly make changes as appropriate. You also have the option to update some of your personal information yourself via your Creative Commons account or profile if you have one.
<h3>22. Access to Personal Information</h3>
Along with all other rights granted to you under applicable laws, you may at any time request to be informed of personal information that Creative Commons holds. If you wish to access such personal information, you should apply in writing to Creative Commons (as identified below, see the “Questions” section). You are generally entitled to access personal information that Creative Commons holds and to have inaccurate data corrected or removed to the extent CC still maintains it. In certain circumstances, you also may have the right to object for legitimate reasons to the processing or transfer of personal information.

If you applied for CCGN membership or acted as a voucher for an applicant, you are generally entitled to access the personal information that Creative Commons holds at the time of your request. However, with the exception of the voucher' decision (e.g., vouch for applicant / does not vouch for applicant) and the applicant's past affiliation(s) with a CC affiliate institution, please note that such data will only be retained by Creative Commons for 21 days of CC's sending out the decision, as described in section 15 above. Thereafter, any other personal information related to the membership application process, including any vouchers’ personal statements or submissions, will be deleted.
<h3>23. Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</h3>
We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will provide you with notice of such update through (at a minimum) a reasonably prominent notice on the Websites and Services, and will revise the Effective Date below. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting, using, processing and transferring the personal information we collect.
<h3>24. Using this Privacy Policy for Your Own Purposes</h3>
The text (but not trademarks, including CC’s name, branding, and look-feel of this site) of this Privacy Policy is dedicated to the public domain under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative Commons CC0 Public Domain Dedication</a>. You are free to use and adapt this Privacy Policy and any applicable Supplemental Privacy Policy Terms for your own purposes but not in connection with the Services of Websites. These terms are provided AS-IS and without any warranty of any type whatsoever (see the text of the CC0 for more). Keep in mind that this Privacy Policy may not be suitable for your situation. Creative Commons strongly encourages you to seek the advice of your own attorney before repurposing this Privacy Policy on your own site. CC is not your attorney, and this is not legal advice.
<h3>25. Questions?</h3>
If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us by email at <a href="legal@creativecommons.org">legal@creativecommons.org</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(28.09.2017 <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/Global_Network_Membership_Charter.md#this-charter">Public Version</a>) </p>

<hr />

<p>This document is the agreement you, an individual person (a "Member") or an institution (an “Institutional Member”), in the Creative Commons Global Network, have with all of the other Members and Institutional Members of the Creative Commons network and Creative Commons (“we” or the “CCGN”). As used in this Charter all references to “Member” or “Members” refers collectively to Members and Institutional Members, though their rights as defined in other CCGN documents differ. </p>

<p>This Charter includes the list of values we share, the principles that guide our work and mutual responsibilities. It also identifies policies with which all Members and others, if acting in the name of Creative Commons (when allowed) or a participant in a Chapter or elsewhere in our network in any capacity, must adhere in order to safeguard the reputation of Creative Commons and the coordination of activities in the course of pursuing our shared mission and objectives.</p>

<h2>Rights and Responsibilities</h2>

<p>Membership in the Creative Commons Global Network is open to any individual or organization that has a demonstrated commitment to supporting the sharing of knowledge and culture, and who shares the values of the community.</p>

<p>Joining as a Member or other participant means joining a global network of individuals and organizations that work together, in many different ways, to promote and enable openness and sharing around the world. We are all collectively committed to building a global network that is supportive and that recognises and celebrates the achievements of others. We expect that as a Member or other participant, you will strive to work collaboratively and help others achieve our shared goals. </p>

<p>Becoming a Member is a position of trust. It means we trust one another to be a face of the Creative Commons community and to collaborate productively and constructively to promote a shared vision and common objectives, consistent with the objectives and activities of your local Chapter, if any. Joining as a Member  also means playing a leadership role in the movement’s international dimension, with expectations to support collective decision-making and advancing the major areas of focus of the network. </p>

<p>All Members are expected to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Abide by the CCGN <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/Global_Network_Membership_Charter.md#codes-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a> </p></li>
<li><p>Abide by policies that Creative Commons establishes and updates from time to time in connection with use of its trademarks, websites and web domains, and similar, which CC pledges to advise members, partners and Chapters of in a timely fashion and to publish in advance as described below</p></li>
<li><p>Work towards the mission of the movement in a way that aligns with its collective strategy</p></li>
<li><p>Always act consistently with the values of the CCGN movement</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate with and support others in the CCGN via mailing lists, or others methods of communication</p></li>
<li><p>Share your work and experiences with the CCGN</p></li>
<li><p>Actively contribute to the CCGN in some way (e.g., participating in a <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy#cc-network-platforms">CC Network Platform</a>)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>The work of a Creative Commons Network Member</h2>

<p>The work of a Creative Commons Network Member  can take place in two overlapping networks - in subject matter specific <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/GlobalNetworkStrategy-Final.md#platform-framework">Platforms</a>, and in geographically specific local <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/GlobalNetworkStrategy-Final.md#chapters">Chapters</a>. </p>

<p>As a Member , you do not have to seek permission to carry out activities that further CC’s mission, as long as they do not conflict with Creative Commons values or the collective strategy and activities of others in the CCGN. You acknowledge that the Chapter in your country or with which you choose to associate may develop and maintain an organizational structure that could include management and coordination, governance processes, designated spokespersons, or designated subject matter leads who speak or direct communications on issues in a specific country. Chapters may also define limits and offer guidance to Members of the Chapter team as to how they can operate and speak on behalf of the Chapter in that country. Members within a country with a Chapter are expected to abide by those, as are other participants working on behalf of CC in the country. On issues of legal interpretation and government policy, among other matters to be identified by Chapters and Creative Commons, Members  and others operating in or in association with a country are expected to coordinate with the local Chapter leadership on these matters, whether or not they participate directly in the Chapter. </p>

<p>In your activities as a Member many Members  will work with others in your country to constitute a <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/GlobalNetworkStrategy-Final.md#chapters">local Chapter</a>, organizing activities consistent and aligned with the CCGN<a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/GlobalNetworkStrategy-Final.md#vision-mission-values-and-guiding-principles"> shared strategic vision</a>. In addition to a local Chapter’s organizational structure as described above, <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/GlobalNetworkStrategy-Final.md#platform-framework">CCGN Platforms</a> frame what a Member or other contributors can say and do on behalf of Creative Commons or the local Chapter. Platforms enable diverse and widespread participation while ensuring that activities of Members and other contributors are strategically aligned and consistent. We welcome your initiative and creativity in how you contribute to the CCGN and our shared goals.</p>

<h2>Codes of Conduct</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>(NOTE: Several sources were consulted in development of the CCGN Code of Conduct, including <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct">Ubuntu Code of Conduct</a> (CC:BY-SA 3.0), <a href="http://contributor-covenant.org/">The Contributor Covenant</a> (CC:BY), the <a href="https://medium.com/square-corner-blog/open-source-code-of-conduct-e5c4dc56229e">Open Source Code of Conduct</a> (CC:BY-SA 3.0) and some ideas from <a href="https://geekfeminism.org/about/code-of-conduct/">Geek Feminism</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>The pledge</h3>

<p>The Creative Commons Global Network is a movement that advocates, promotes and enables openness and sharing around the world. This is an open, safe and inclusive space fostering sharing and collaboration regardless of age, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.</p>

<p>We are committed to making it as inclusive as possible, and hope that everyone feels encouraged and excited about participating in the process by sharing opinions, suggestions and concerns about what we believe we can and should develop for our common future: the Creative Commons Global Network.</p>

<h3>Guiding Principles</h3>

<p><strong>Be welcoming</strong>. All of the Members of this community have different backgrounds and experiences. We expect all Members to welcome new Members, and have special consideration to help them orient themselves in the network.</p>

<p><strong>Be respectful</strong>. Disagreement is no excuse for disrespectful behaviour. We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathic fashion. We will not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination in our communities. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not productive. Be thoughtful in the words that you choose. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. </p>

<p>Different people have different perspective on issues. Being able to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean they are wrong. Disagreements, social and technical, are normal, but we will not allow them to persist and fester leaving others uncertain of the agreed direction. We expect participants in any  project to resolve disagreements constructively. When they cannot, matters should be  escalated within established  structures for resolution.</p>

<p>Always remember, CCGN is a diverse and global community where English is not the first language for the vast majority of participants. Always try to pick the short way to express the idea you are trying to share, considering the language and cultural barrier always present. </p>

<p><strong>Be considerate</strong>. Our work will be used by other people, and we in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and we should consider them when making decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Be collaborative</strong>. Collaboration between people that each have their own goal and vision is essential. Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work. Wherever possible, we work closely with other projects and communities on the <em>Open world</em> to coordinate our efforts. We prefer to work transparently and involve interested parties as early as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Ask for help when unsure</strong>. Nobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Share leadership</strong>. The most powerful way a community can advance its cause is by bringing in new people, and helping them to become leaders. The most influential among us should actively seek to mentor, promote, advise, and advance those with potential to have impact in their communities, and as part of our global network.</p>

<h3>Reporting Issues</h3>

<p>If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior — or have any other concerns — please report it by emailing members-support@creativecommons.org. For more details, please see our Reporting Guidelines below.</p>

<h4>Reporting Guide</h4>

<p>If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior — or have any other concerns — please report it by emailing members-support@creativecommons.org. All reports will be handled with discretion.</p>

<p>In your report please include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your contact information.</p></li>
<li><p>Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a Slack logger or similar), please include a link.</p></li>
<li><p>Any additional information that may be helpful.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>After filing a report, a representative from Creative Commons or the GNC (with support from Creative Commons) will contact you personally. The incident will be reviewed, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond.</p>

<p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior at odds with or in the spirit of this Code of Conduct is expected to do so immediately. If an individual continues to engage in unacceptable behavior, Creative Commons may take any action it deems appropriate, up to and including a permanent ban from the Creative Commons Global Network without further warning.</p>

<h2>CC Policies</h2>

<p>Creative Commons establishes policies regarding its trademarks and domain names, use of its internet services including subdomains, and similar. Most of these policies are allowed to give you permission in advance, rather than requiring you as a Member or other participant to ask first. These policies are revised periodically by Creative Commons after consultation with the CC Global Network Council and are published at <a href="https://creativecommons.org/policies">https://creativecommons.org/policies</a>. </p>

<p>For the avoidance of doubt, while we use the term "Member" to refer to individuals and organizations admitted to the CCGN upon agreement with this Charter, that does not make them a member, partner, agent or employee of Creative Commons as a legal matter, or of any other Member  or participant in the CCGN. More details are provided in the Policies linked to above. </p>

<h2>This Charter</h2>

<p>This Charter is first published on October 6th, 2017, concurrently with the announcement that Members may start to join the CCGN. Please note, that this Charter may be amended from time to time by Creative Commons in consultation and collaboration with the Global Network Council. When changes are made, then-current Members will be notified of changes and will be deemed to have agreed and be bound by them unless they withdraw within 30 calendar days of receiving notice.  If a Member does withdraw, then notwithstanding that withdrawal, in the event they participate in a Chapter, Platform or Working Group, or otherwise participate in their country on behalf of CC (such as holding themselves out as a participant in the CCGN), the Charter (as amended) and the CC Policies and any other policies and procedures established by the Platform or Working Group will apply to such activities.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Documentation and Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
The new Creative Commons Global Network is the result of a comprehensive and collaborative effort by the CC movement to renew and grow its network, finalized at the 2017 Global Summit in Toronto.

&nbsp;

It’s important to acknowledge the hard work of all the people involved from the beginning, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/global-affiliate-network/faces-commons-research/">which included research</a> (the Faces of the Commons is a 300 page multi region report with recommendations and insights), an open consultation with the broad CC community including CC Affiliates, partners, funders, and the CC Board, and 22 online and in-person meetings. More than the 80 percent of the active members of the network were involved in the process. You can read the full <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/GlobalNetworkStrategy-Final.md">Global Network Strategy</a>, as well as other documentation of the process, in our <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy">Github repository</a>.

&nbsp;

We have developed a lot of documentation to guide the Network process, including documentation <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/Guide_for_vouching_applicants.md">for vouching</a>, for <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/Guide_for_creating_a_chapter.md">creating a Chapter</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/Guide_to_becoming_an_institutional_member.md">Guide for being an Institutional Member</a>, etc.
<h2></h2>
<h2>Legal Policies</h2>
&nbsp;

When you participate in the Creative Commons Global Network (“CCGN”), there are several legal policies that you should read because they apply to you as you engage with CC and the network.

&nbsp;

The following policies apply to everyone who participates in the CCGN:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://creativecommons.org/network/charter/">Global Network Charter</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://creativecommons.org/policies/#network">Chapter Logo Policy</a></li>
 	<li>CCGN Internet Services Policy</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

If and when you become a member of the CCGN, you must also follow <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/Guide_for_vouching_applicants.md">the guidelines for </a>vouching applicants to the network. Members of the <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/the-interim-membership-council.md">Global Network Council</a> must also follow the <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/Guide_for_approve_new_members.md">guidelines for approving new CCGN members</a>.

&nbsp;

Note that all of the CC policies that apply to the general public, such as the CC Trademark Policy, also apply to people involved in the CCGN. You can review all of those policies <a href="https://creativecommons.org/policies/">here</a>.

<blockquote>
<h2></h2>
<h2>What is Creative Commons and what is a Creative Commons license?</h2>
<p class="item-content">Creative Commons is a global nonprofit organization that enables sharing and reuse of creativity and knowledge through the provision of free legal tools. With a network of staff, board, and members around the world, Creative Commons provides a suite of free, easy-to-use copyright licenses to provide a simple and standardized way to give the public permission to share and use your creative work on conditions of your choice. For more information about what Creative Commons do and how Creative Commons Licenses work, visit <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">creativecommons.org</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
</article><article class="item-acordion">
<h2>What is the CC Global Network?</h2>
<p class="item-content">A vital part of Creative Commons movement is its network of people around the world who share CC’s visions and values. From translating licenses to advocating for the adoption of CC licenses in local policies, individual/institutional members and supporters of CC around the world have served as CC representatives in their regions and come together around common issues such as copyright reform, open education, etc. to have a global impact.</p>

</article><article class="item-acordion">
<h2>What is this website?</h2>
<p class="item-content">This website is the hub for the Creative Commons Global Network where you can find out about the Network, who they are, what they do, how they work together (and independently). This site is where you can apply to join the network as an individual or institutional member.</p>

</article><article class="item-acordion">
<h2>How does the CC Global Network work?</h2>
<p class="item-content">Composed of Individual and Institutional Members and contributors, the CC Global Network is the overarching structure to help coordinate and provide leadership in the global Creative Commons movement. The CC Global Network as a whole pursues and holds true to the visions, missions, values and guiding principles defined in the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GlobalNetworkStrategy-Final.pdf">Global Network Strategy</a> and <a href="https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Global_Network_Membership_Charter.pdf">Global Network Membership Charter</a>. Although it shares the same visions and values with and supported by CC HQ, the CC Global Network has a separate governance structure.</p>
<p class="item-content">There are three key elements of the Global Network: Chapters, Platforms, and Governance through the Global Network Council.
A Chapter is constituted by all Individual/Institutional Members and other people who promote CC ("Contributors") in a particular country. Contributors who are not Members may also participate in Chapters. How Chapters organize themselves should be determined locally and will depend on local characteristics, preferences, needs, resources, and priorities.
A Platform is an "area of work" that can have goals, objectives, policy positions, individual and collaborative activities, and possibly also specific programs. Platforms are enabling structures for activities carried out by Network Members and Contributors and are a way of organizing and coordinating collaboration across the network. While decision-making is limited to Network Members, participation in platform activities is open to anyone, just like in Chapters.
The Global Network Council is the governing and decision-making body of the Global Network. It consists of elected representatives of all CC Chapters and representatives from CC HQ.</p>

</article><article class="item-acordion">
<h2>Who is part of the CC Network?</h2>
<p class="item-content">CC Global Network is open to anyone who would like to contribute to Creative Commons movement. While Individual and Institutional Members are core participants in the network’s governance processes and the international work of the network, other Chapter participants or independent CC advocates participating in CC Platforms are also part of CC Network. Artists or collaborators who do a project at an event organized by CC and engage with other CC supporters are also equally welcome as contributors to the CC Global Network.</p>

</article><article class="item-acordion">
<h2>Do I need to be a member to participate in the Network?</h2>
<p class="item-content">No. Being a member is just one of the ways to participate in the Network. You can launch a CC project in your region with other members in your Chapter as a contributor. If you are interested in a specific area or issue, e.g. OER, you can participate in the OER Platform or any other Platform as a non-member. Membership is for those who are interested in playing a leadership role in the governance of the Network.</p>

</article><article class="item-acordion">
<h2>Is there a membership fee?</h2>
<p class="item-content">No! We believe Creative Commons is a nonprofit and has been and can continue to be a thriving open community where everyone feels welcome to participate and contribute whether they afford to a membership fee or not. However, we’d greatly appreciate your support and your donations are always welcome. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/donate">Help us build a vibrant, collaborative global commons by donating today</a>.</p>

</article><article class="item-acordion">
<h2>What do I need to apply for a membership?</h2>
<p class="item-content">You don’t have to be a member to do a CC project in your region or participate in a Platform. But if you are keen to involve more deeply in and play a leadership role in the movement’s international dimension or to be involved more deeply in collective decision-making on key issues of the network, you might want to consider applying for a membership. As an Individual Member, you can create a Chapter and/or represent your Chapter at the Global Network Council.</p>

</article><article class="item-acordion">
<h2>What is the process? Is it difficult? How long will it take?</h2>
<p class="item-content">It’s quite simple. To become a member of the CC Global Network,
1) You must agree to the Charter
2) Provide some track record of contributing to the CC movement
3) Be vouched by two current network members.
These requirements equally apply to Individual Members and Institutional Members. Once you agree to the Charter and submit an application through this website, your application will be first reviewed by the two vouchers based on transparent <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/Guide_for_vouching_applicants.md">criteria</a> and the Global Network Council will make a final decision to approve or deny the application. We expect this to be a quick process, and it should not take more than 2 to 4 weeks to receive the final result, depending on the capacity of the council. If you have any questions about the process, contact us network-support@creativecommons.org.</p>

</article><article class="item-acordion">
<h2>What is CCID? Do I really need one?</h2>
<p class="item-content">CCID is a universal login for all Creative Commons services, from editing the CC wiki to accessing Global Network website. You can register for a CCID <a href="https://login.creativecommons.org/register.php">here</a> with an email address, a given name and a password. As a first step in the membership process, we request users to have a CCID so that we can store your profile data in our database to help you access your application during the application process and then the information disclosed only to members of the network once you have joined as a member.</p>

</article><article class="item-acordion">
<h2>Can the institution I work for join the Network?</h2>
<p class="item-content">Yes. Not only individuals but also institutions can become an official Member of the Network and the basic requirements are the same – agreeing to the Charter and being vouched by two current individual members. In addition to these requirements, there may be additional minimum agreements to be signed with CC organization regarding trademark and other legal issues. For more information, please contact us at network-support@creativecommons.org.</p>

</article><article class="item-acordion">
<h2>I want to apply for an institutional membership on behalf of my organization. Can I still become an individual member? Or would I be automatically accepted as an individual member?</h2>
<p class="item-content">Institutional membership and individual membership are two separate membership programs that do not exclude each other. Anyone who is an institutional member - meaning who is employed by or in any other formal relationship with the given institution - can apply to become an individual member regardless of the membership status of their institution. No matter how many individual members a given institution has, anyone, whether she is an individual member or not, can apply for an institutional membership on behalf of the organization. Membership status of your institution neither affect membership status of its employees nor guarantees that your individual membership application is approved automatically. You must go through the same application process as anyone else to become an individual member.
The only thing you may want to take note of if you are interested in both membership programs is that the institution cannot be vouched by individual members associated with the institution. In other words, names listed in an institutional membership application as vouchers must be those that have no formal relationship with the institution.</p>

</article><article class="item-acordion">
<h2>What is a Chapter?</h2>
<p class="item-content">Chapters are the hub of local CC activities in a particular country. Constituted by Network Members and other participants of CC within a country, a chapter may develop and maintain an organizational structure and governance processes of its own and offer guidance and direction to Members and other participants within the country as to how they can operate and speak on behalf of the Chapter in that country. All Chapters must make sure their activities are in line with the CC Global Network’s shared strategic vision,  For more information about roles and responsibilities of a Chapter, read <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/chapters-guidelines.md">this</a>.</p>

</article><article class="item-acordion">
<h2>Can I start a new Chapter in my Country?</h2>
<p class="item-content">Make sure to check if a Chapter already exists in your country. If there is no Chapter in your country, and if you are an Individual Member of CC Global Network, then you are eligible to start a new Chapter in your country. Even then, we recommend you confirm with the Creative Commons Headquarters (CC HQ) first whether there is any individual or community interested in creating a Chapter in your country. It is also possible that there’s someone who has already been in discussion to create a Chapter, in which case we might be able to connect you with them!</p>

</article><article class="item-acordion">
<h2>How can I find out if there’s a Chapter in my country already?</h2>
<p class="item-content">While we are trying to provide the most up-to-date list of Chapters on this website, chances are there are some prospective Chapters or potential communities that are not publicly visible. Please write to network-support@creativecommons.org and we will help you find your local Chapter or connect you to potential communities in your country.</p>

</article><article class="item-acordion">
<h2>Can I start a Chapter in my city or university?</h2>
<p class="item-content">For purposes of governance the Network, only one Chapter can exist per country and Chapters must be open to any Member or participants within that country. A university can participate in a Chapter as an Institutional Member or Contributor, but an individual cannot start a Chapter for your city or within a university. However, there may be limited circumstances where there is good reason to have more than one team within a given country. The Global Network Council will review these on a case-by-case basis.<span style="color: #666666; font-size: 1.25rem;"> </span></p>

</article><article class="item-acordion">
<h2>Can I participate in more than one Chapter?</h2>
<p class="item-content">Yes and no, depending on the type of relationship you are looking for. You are free to do projects or collaborate with other members in as many countries or regions as you want, but you may be affiliated with only one Chapter at a time when it comes to governance of Chapters and how CC Global Network works. For example, you are only able to represent one Chapter at the GNC at a time. Chapters may also define limits and offer guidance to Members of the Chapter team as to how they can operate and speak on behalf of the Chapter in that country. Members within a country that has a Chapter are expected to abide by those rules, as are other participants working on behalf of CC in the country.</p>

</article><article class="item-acordion">
<h2>What is The Charter?</h2>
<p class="item-content">The Charter is the agreement between an individual person or an institution that the Creative Commons Global Network has with all of the other Members and Institutional Members of the Creative Commons network and Creative Commons. It includes the list of values we share, the principles that guide our work, and our and mutual responsibilities. It also identifies policies with which all Members and others, if acting in the name of Creative Commons (when allowed) or a participant in a Chapter or elsewhere in our network in any capacity, must adhere in order to safeguard the reputation of Creative Commons and the coordination of activities in the course of pursuing our shared mission and objectives.
Any individual or institution must agree to the Charter to apply to become a Member of the Network.</p>

</article><article class="item-acordion">
<h2>What happens to the Affiliate Agreement or Memorandum of Understanding that I or my organisation have with Creative Commons under the new CCGN structure?</h2>
<p class="item-content">Generally, all Affiliate Agreements and MOUs will be terminated by Creative Commons at some point between now and the 2018 Global Summit. If you are applying to become an organizational member of the CCGN, the CC legal team will be in touch before membership is approved to make arrangements for termination of existing agreements with your institution and Creative Commons. If you are not applying to join the CCGN, CC will contact you in advance of the 2018 Global Summit to confirm the date of termination of your agreements, consistent with the terms and conditions of those agreements. No Affiliate Agreements or MOUs will remain in effect after the 2018 Global Summit, absent unique circumstances. Please plan accordingly.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Creative Commons new Global Network is the result of a comprehensive and collaborative effort from the CC movement to renew and grow its network, finalized at the 2017 Global Summit in Toronto.

It’s important to acknowledge the hard work of all the people involved from the beginning, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/global-affiliate-network/faces-commons-research/" rel="nofollow">which included research</a> (the Faces of the Commons is a 300 page multi region report with recommendations and insights), an open consultation with the broad CC community including Affiliates, partners, funders, and the CC Board, and 22 online and in-person meetings and more than the eighty percent of the active members of the network involved.

We have developed a lot of documentation to guide the Network process, including documentation <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/Guide_for_vouching_applicants.md">for vouching</a>, for <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/Guide_for_creating_a_chapter.md">creating a Chapter</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/Guide_to_becoming_an_institutional_member.md">Guide for being an Institutional Member</a>, etc.
<ul>
